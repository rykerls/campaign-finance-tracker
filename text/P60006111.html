<p>Senator Ted Cruz's total rasied of $54 M seems low in comparison to the Democratic candidates, but in a crowded Republican primary he is one of the frontrunners in frundraising. Nearly all of his money has come from individual donations, and his spending strategy seems to mirror that of Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton, with Cruz spending 74.9% of his donations to date compared with Clintons's 75%.</p> 

<p>Cruz's $14.4 M raised from his home state of Texas is not surprising, and accounts for over a quarter of the money he has raised. The only other state in which Cruz was able to raise over $2 M is California. Where Cruz stands out is the amounts he has recieved his donations in, with over 70% of his funding coming from donations under $200.</p>
